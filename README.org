* ~cmus~ theme: Gruvbox-night
There are other Gruvbox-ey themes for [[https://cmus.github.io/][cmus]] out there, but I wanted
something simple, and slightly more subded than what I saw.

I used the built-in ~night~ theme as a starting point, and used the
color choice from the official Gruvbox theme for terminal Vim.

** Installation
Put the file ~Gruvbox-night.theme~ in the folder ~~/.config/cmus/~. 
It should now be possible to set the theme from cmus with the command

#+begin_src 
:colorscheme Gruvbox-night
#+end_src

* Emacs
I love gruvbox and I love [[https://www.orgmode.org][Org-mode]], but I was unhappy with how
org-mode looks in the Gruvbox implementations I have seen (i.e., in
the ~gruvbox-theme~ and ~doom-themes~ packages).

In addition, I also made some small tweaks to colors for
[[https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline][Doom-Modeline]], line numbers, and some nicer colors for [[https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html][Mu4E]]. If you do
not want some of these, just remove these sections from your config. 

** What it is
Some things I wanted and have implemented here:
- Title, author etc. are set up to look similar to what they would in
  an actual document. Particularly, they are bold and larger, but
  otherwise the same color as normal text. 
- Heading levels are encoded with a smooth color gradient. That way, a
  quick glance can tell you how deep your current heading is. It also
  looks more smooth, less Angry Fruit Saladâ„¢ -ey. They are slightly
  larger than normal text, but all the same size, to subtly tell the
  eye that this is a heading without breaking the general reading
  flow. 
- I wanted citations to look different than links, similar to what you
  can do with the \LaTeX Hyperref package. Other links all have the
  same colors. 
- Blocks should be easy to tell apart from the surrounding text, but
  not be so different that it breaks the reading flow and becomes a
  distraction. They are therefore simply set to be one tone darker
  than the general text background. 
- Non-text content should not steal my attention. Therefore, comments,
  drawers, tags, properties, block delimiters etc. are all in subdued
  gray on darker gray background.

I am not an (e)lisp programmer, so I found a code snippet online
(forgot the source, sorry), which modifies a theme when loaded. This
may be a clumsy way of doing it, I don't know a parenthesis from a
brace in elisp. 

** Dependencies
This implementation assumes you have ~use-package~ installed. Possibly
that is not necessary, I may prettify the code later, suggestions/pull
requests are welcome.

** Installation
Just copy the contents of the file [[./Emacs/gruvbox-conf.el]] into your
config somewhere. Once Emacs is restarted and you load the Gruvbox
theme, the changes should show up. 

** Screenshot
Because it is much easier to see if you like it this way.
