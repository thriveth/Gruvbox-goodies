** ~cmus~ theme: Gruvbox-night
There are other Gruvbox-ey themes for [[https://cmus.github.io/][~cmus~]] out there, but I wanted
something simple, and slightly more subded than what I saw.

I used the built-in ~night~ theme as a starting point, and used the
color choice from the official Gruvbox theme for terminal Vim.

** Emacs
I made an extension of the Emacs gruvbox theme to make it look better
with org-mode. Will upload soon, I swear.
